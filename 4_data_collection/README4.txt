Data Collection Overview

This project does not include automated data collection scripts.

PlantPal uses a pre-populated plant dataset stored directly in the database. All plant data was manually collected and entered into the database to ensure accuracy and relevance for houseplant care.

Since the application focuses on CRUD operations and personalized reminders rather than real-time external data gathering, no data scraping or collection automation was implemented.

Future improvements may include APIs or scripts to pull updated plant information from horticulture databases or public APIs.
