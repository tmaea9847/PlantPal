Integration Testing Overview

Formal automated integration testing was not implemented for this version of the PlantPal project.

However, manual integration testing was performed to ensure that various components of the application work together as expected. This included testing workflows such as:

- User registration and login
- Adding plants to the user library
- Saving reminders for specific plants
- Displaying personalized plant stats on the dashboard
- Adding and retrieving notes

Each of these processes was tested through the user interface in a local XAMPP environment. Results confirmed that the backend logic, database connections, and front-end elements are integrated and functioning correctly.

Future versions may include scripted integration testing with PHPUnit or similar tools.
